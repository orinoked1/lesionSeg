# lesionSeg

this project was designed to train and test a neural network for semantic segmentation of oral lesions.
the cod has 3 entry points:
1. trian_model.py - train a specific configuration model
2. hyperparameters_serch.py - search best hyperparameters configuration (using ray[tune])
3. test_model.py - test (using the test set) a trained model.

our best model can be found in google drive 

example data can be found in data /exmple_data 

anaconda requirements can be found in /conda_env/environment.yml
